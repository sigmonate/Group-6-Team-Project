        It is also important to notice that San Francisco is following close

        recorded per city, it is important to take into consideration that

        data into this data set from June 2003, while Chicago, Denver, Houston,
        Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco started recording their

        linear increase in gas prices over the years, and that the 2008 financial
        crisis resulted in gas prices rising substantially in many US urban areas.
        Included above are two tables, the first of which shows when the highest
        gas prices were recorded in each city, and the second showing when each
        city recorded their lowest gas prices. These tables both draw support to
        the conclusion made earlier that gas prices across American cities fluctuate
        together. For instance, it can be seen that six cities recorded their highest
        gas prices in July of 2008, while four cities recorded their lowest gas
        prices in December of 2001. Our group feels that we selected a very strong, reliable, and comprehensive
        dataset. Because the data recorded in this dataset was strictly numerical,
        and with its source being the US Energy Information Administration, we believe
        that our dataset provides relatively unbiased results. The numbers provided
        in the data averaged all prices for all grades of gasoline, so our group
        feels that the data couldn't have harmed or underrepresented other population
        groups of varying socioeconomic/financial status. We believe that it would
        be very worthwhile to continually update this project in the future. As
        time progresses, gas prices will continue to fluctuate and be tracked, which
        will allow for other researchers to explore these trends and draw new conclusions
        from these data.")
